## Fixed Issues
- Label logic (Red=1, Blue=0)
- EV calculation formula
- Kaggle paths removed
- Data validation added

---
## Core Problem
- Using odds to predict outcomes is circular logic
- Odds already contain market predictions
---
## Better Approach
- Use fighter stats to generate probabilities
- Compare model predictions vs market odds
- Find value bets where model disagrees with bookmakers
---
## Missing
- Implied probability conversion
- Time-based train/test splits
- Bankroll management
- Bet sizing strategy
- Multiple sportsbook data
